# <Password-Generator>
## Description
-This project is a password generator. It will take in a user input for password length and user prompts for which character types to include in the password. It will then generate a random mix of those characters on the page.

- This project taught me a lot about functions, if statements, arrays and having those types nested within each other to create a functional outcome.
